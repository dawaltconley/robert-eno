人	ren2	(N) person; humankind [1]
也	ye3	(Particle) yě is affixed to close of an equational sentence to indicate that the sentence has the semantic form: “X is Y”; yě also appears in mid- sentence, where its function as a stressed pause often indicates the close of a topic phrase (a sentence-opening phrase that might be thought of as preceded by an “as for” and followed by a predicate-comment) [1]

哀	ai1	(SV) lamentable; (V) to lament; to mourn [1]

而	er2	(Conjunction) Links two verb phrases. Often rendered literally as “and under these conditions,” ér is often functionally equivalent to “and,” but never links nouns or noun phrases. (The force of ér may sometimes be captured by adding “-ing” to the verb in the first phrase and resuming the subject before the second phrase, though that is not appropriate in this case.) At times, ér carries a sense of “contrary to expectations,” which pertains to its first three instances in this passage, and most emphatically to the third. [1]; (Pronoun) you [11]
