# Robert Eno Flashcards

This repo hosts text files for the vocabulary in Robert Eno's _Introduction to 
Literary Chinese_ that can be imported into Pleco either as flashcards or 
dictionary entries.

Eno's primers are publicly available 
[here](https://scholarworks.iu.edu/iuswrrest/api/core/bitstreams/94812cab-d710-41a9-a0d9-7e1c593506de/content).

So far, only vocab for Part One is included; I'll add Part Two when I get to 
it. Please open an issue if you find any problems.
